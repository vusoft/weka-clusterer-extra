Weka is the Data-mining software (open source) in Java (http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/weka/).
It lacks some advanced cluster evaluations and algorithms such as Silhouette Coefficient, Cophenetic Distance Matrix and so on.
We include these additional features into original Weka package, compile and provide it  for free.
